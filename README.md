## How to Use This Course

Follow this step-by-step learning flow for each level:

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
1. Navigate to the `data/` folder
2. Follow the setup instructions in `data/README.md`
3. Run the setup script to prepare the practice datasets

### Step 2: Read the Lessons
1. Start with the first lesson in the level (e.g., `lesson-01-introduction.md`)
2. Read through all lessons in the level sequentially
3. Type out and run the example code yourself
4. Experiment with modifying the examples to deepen understanding

### Step 3: Attempt the Exercises
1. Open the exercises file (e.g., `exercises-01.md`)
2. **Write your own Python solutions** for each exercise
3. Test your solutions by running them
4. Verify your results match the expected output format

### Step 4: Debug and Iterate
1. If code doesn't work, read the error message carefully
2. Review the relevant lesson sections
3. Check the hints in the exercises file (only if you're stuck)
4. Refine your solution until it works correctly

### Step 5: Move Forward
1. Once you've completed all exercises in a level, move to the next level
2. Don't skip exercises - they're essential for building skills
3. Revisit previous lessons if you need a refresher

## Learning Tips

- **Start simple**: Begin with Level 1 and progress sequentially - each level builds on previous concepts
- **Practice actively**: Don't just read - write and run every piece of code yourself
- **Use hints wisely**: Only check hints when you're genuinely stuck, not as a first resort
- **Test incrementally**: Build code step by step, testing as you go
- **Review when needed**: Return to previous lessons if concepts need reinforcement
- **Build projects**: Apply learned concepts to real-world scenarios outside the exercises
- **Be patient**: Mastery comes through practice - don't rush through exercises

## Getting Started

1. **Read the Learning Guide**: Start with `LEARNING-GUIDE.md` for complete instructions on:
   - How to set up Python and required packages
